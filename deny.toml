# The "allow" list should only include licenses actually in use.
# To review current licenses in the dependency tree, run:
#
#   cargo deny list
#
# If new licenses appear in your dependencies, you can add them here.
# Avoid leaving unused licenses in the list, as this causes
# `license-not-encountered` warnings in CI.
